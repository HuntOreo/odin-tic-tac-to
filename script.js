/* 
Main Goal:
  Build a functional Tic Tac Toe game.
  Use as little globally scoped code as possible.
 
Requirements:
  Use Factory Functions
    For single instance objects like game-board, 
    or displayContainer, use IIFE module patterns so that 
    it cannot be reused to create additional instances.
  
  Store the game-board inside of an array!
  
  Players will be stored in objects.

  Control game-flow with an object.
